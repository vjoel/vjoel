I'm <a rel="me" href="https://mastodon.social/@joelvanderwerf">@joelvanderwerf@mastodon.social</a>.

I mostly use a private network of gitolite instances instead of github, so these are old projects. Just to mention one, which might be useful someday: RedShift is a modeling and simulation framework for dynamic networks of hybrid automata (AKA Cyber-Physical Systems), based on (obsolete) SHIFT. Nothing else does quite what these two languages do. Check out the examples. You'll need ruby and a working C compiler.
